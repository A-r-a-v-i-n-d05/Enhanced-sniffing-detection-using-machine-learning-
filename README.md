# Enhanced-sniffing-detection-using-machine-learning-
Developed a network security system to detect sniffing attacks (such as packet sniffers like Wireshark, tcpdump) using supervised machine learning techniques. The project focused on identifying malicious network behavior that indicates passive eavesdropping on network traffic.
